<h1>The 20 Healthiest Fruits on the Planet</h1>
<img src="images/fruit.jpg" align="left" width="500" height="400">
<p align="justify">1. Grapefruit
Grapefruit is one of the healthiest citrus fruits.

Besides being a good source of vitamins and minerals, it is known for its ability to aid weight loss and reduce insulin resistance.

For example, in a study in 91 people, those who ate half a fresh grapefruit before meals lost 2.9 pounds (1.3 kg) more weight than those who didn’t (1Trusted Source).

In the same study, the grapefruit group had a significant reduction in insulin levels and reduced insulin resistance (1Trusted Source).

Also, eating grapefruit has been shown to reduce cholesterol levels and help prevent kidney stones (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).

Bottom
Line: Grapefruit is highly nutritious. Eating it may reduce
insulin resistance, cholesterol and help prevent kidney stones. Grapefruit may
also be useful for weight loss.

2. Pineapple
Among the tropical fruits, pineapple is a nutrition superstar. One cup (237 ml) of pineapple provides 131% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for vitamin C and 76% of the RDI for manganese (5).

Pineapple also contains bromelain, a mixture of enzymes known for its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to digest protein (6Trusted Source).

Test-tube and animal studies suggest that bromelain may help protect against cancer and tumor growth (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).

Bottom
Line: Pineapple is rich in vitamin C and manganese. Its
bromelain content may fight inflammation and reduce the risk of cancer.

3. Avocado
Avocado is different from most other fruits.

Most fruits are high in carbs, while avocado is low in carbs and comprised mainly of healthy fats.

The majority of the fat in avocado is oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat linked to reduced inflammation and better heart health (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).

In addition to healthy fats, avocados are loaded with potassium, fiber and magnesium (11).

One whole avocado provides 28% of the RDI for potassium. Adequate potassium intake is associated with reduced blood pressure and a lower risk of stroke (11, 12Trusted Source).

Bottom
Line: Avocados are rich in healthy fats and potassium, both of
which are well known for their role in promoting heart health.

4. Blueberries
Blueberries have powerful health benefits.

They have an impressive nutrition profile, being particularly high in fiber, vitamin C, vitamin K and manganese (13).

Blueberries are also exceptionally high in antioxidants.

In fact, they are believed to contain the highest antioxidant content of the most commonly consumed fruits (14Trusted Source).

The antioxidants in blueberries may reduce the risk of chronic conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer’s (15Trusted Source).

Blueberries are also known for their powerful effects on the immune system.

One study found that eating blueberries regularly may increase natural killer cells in the body. These help defend you against oxidative stress and viral infections (16Trusted Source).

Additionally, the antioxidants in blueberries may have a protective effect on your brain. For example, eating blueberries has been shown to improve memory in older adults (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).

Bottom
Line: Blueberries are rich in a few important nutrients. They
have a high antioxidant capacity and immune-enhancing properties, which may
protect the body from illness.

5. Apples
Apples are among the most popular fruits, and also happen to be incredibly nutritious.

They contain a high amount of fiber, vitamin C, potassium and vitamin K. They also provide some B vitamins (19).

Studies suggest that the antioxidants in apples can promote heart health and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer’s (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).

The antioxidant activity in apples has also been linked with increased bone density in animal and test-tube studies (24Trusted Source).

Another notable health benefit of apples is their pectin content.

Pectin is a prebiotic fiber that feeds the good bacteria in your gut and helps improve digestion and metabolic health (25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).

Bottom
Line: Apples are very nutritious. Their nutrients, antioxidants
and fiber may reduce the risk of disease and improve digestion.

6. Pomegranate
Pomegranates are among the healthiest fruits you can eat.

Not only are they nutrient dense, they also contain powerful plant compounds that are responsible for most of their health benefits.

The antioxidant levels in pomegranate have been shown to be three times higher than those of green tea and red wine (27Trusted Source).

Studies have also shown that pomegranates have anti-inflammatory effects and may help reduce the risk of cancer (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source).

Bottom
Line: Pomegranates have wide-ranging health benefits. They are
incredibly high in antioxidants and other plant compounds that can help reduce
inflammation and prevent disease.

7. Mango
Mangoes are an excellent source of vitamin C.

They also contain soluble fiber, which can provide many health benefits.

Additionally, mangoes have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce the risk of disease (31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source).

In animal studies, the plant compounds in mangoes have been shown to protect against diabetes (31Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).

Bottom
Line: Mangoes contain vitamin C and soluble fiber. They also
contain plant compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

8. Strawberries
Strawberries are highly nutritious.

Their vitamin C, manganese, folate and potassium contents are where they really shine (34).

Compared to other fruits, strawberries have a relatively low glycemic index. Eating them shouldn’t cause a big blood sugar spike (35, 36Trusted Source).

Similarly to other berries, strawberries have a high antioxidant capacity, which may reduce your risk of chronic disease (37Trusted Source).

Animal and test-tube studies have found that strawberries may also help prevent cancer and tumor formation (38Trusted Source, 39Trusted Source).

Bottom
Line: Strawberries are rich in several nutrients and
antioxidants. Eating them may help control your blood sugar levels and reduce
your risk of some diseases.

9. Cranberries
Cranberries have impressive health benefits.

They have an excellent nutrition profile, being rich in vitamin C, manganese, vitamin E, vitamin K1 and copper (40).

They also contain a significant amount of antioxidants called flavanol polyphenols, which can improve health (41Trusted Source, 42Trusted Source).

What makes cranberries unique from other fruits is that their juices and extracts help prevent urinary tract infections (43Trusted Source, 44Trusted Source).

A-Type proanthocyanidins are the compounds thought to be responsible for this effect, as they can prevent bacteria from attaching to the lining of the bladder and urinary tract (43Trusted Source, 44Trusted Source).

Bottom
Line: Cranberries are rich in several nutrients and
antioxidants. They also contain beneficial plant compounds that help prevent
urinary tract infections.

10. Lemons
Lemons are a very healthy citrus fruit known for their high vitamin C content.

They may be particularly helpful in promoting heart health due to their potential to lower blood lipids and blood pressure (45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source).

Based on findings from animal studies, researchers have also proposed that the plant compounds in lemons can help prevent weight gain (47Trusted Source, 48Trusted Source).

Other studies show that the citric acid in lemon juice has the ability to treat kidney stones (49Trusted Source).

Bottom
Line: Lemons are rich in vitamin C and other plant compounds
that may promote heart health, boost weight loss and help prevent kidney
stones.

Some of watermelon’s antioxidants have been studied for their anti-cancer effects.

Lycopene intake is linked with a reduced risk of cancers of the digestive system, while cucurbitacin E may inhibit tumor growth (52Trusted Source, 53Trusted Source).

Consuming lycopene-rich foods can also promote heart health because of their ability to reduce cholesterol and blood pressure (52Trusted Source).

Of all the fruits, watermelon is one of the most hydrating. It is made up of 92% water, which can help you feel more full (52Trusted Source).
