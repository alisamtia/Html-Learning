Default theme for 2020.

== Description ==

Our default theme for 2020 is designed to take full advantage of the 
flexibility of the block editor. Organizations and businesses have the 
ability to create dynamic landing pages with endless layouts using the 
group and column blocks. The centered content column and fine-tuned 
typography also makes it perfect for traditional blogs. Complete editor 
styles give you a good idea of what your content will look like, even 
before you publish. You can give your site a personal touch by changing 
the background colors and the accent color in the Customizer. The colors of 
all elements on your site are automatically calculated based on the colors 
you pick, ensuring a high, accessible color contrast for your visitors.
