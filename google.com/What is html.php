<h1>What is HTML? The Basics of Hypertext Markup Language Explained</h1>
<img src="images/15 vegetable image.jpg" align="left" width="500" height="400">
<p align="justify">HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.

HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and attributes) to mark up a website page. For example, we can create a paragraph by placing the enclosed text within a starting  and closing  tag.

This is how you add a paragraph in HTML.
You can have more than one!
The image tag also has two attributes: src for the image path and alt for the image description.
Overviewing The Most Used HTML Tags
HTML tags have two main types: block-level and inline tags.

Block-level elements take up the full available space and always start a new line in the document. Headings and paragraphs are a great example of block tags.
Inline elements only take up as much space as they need and don’t start a new line on the page. They usually serve to format the inner contents of block-level elements. Links and emphasized strings are good examples of inline tags.
Block-Level Tags
The three block level tags every HTML document needs to contain are , , and 
The  tag is the highest level element that encloses every HTML page.
The  tag holds meta information such as the page’s title and charset.
Finally, the tag encloses all the content that appears on the page.

Headings have 6 levels in HTML. They range from where h1 is the highest level heading and h6 is the lowest one. Paragraphs are enclosed by, while blockquotes use the tag.
Divisions are bigger content sections that typically contain several paragraphs, images, sometimes blockquotes, and other smaller elements. We can mark them up using the tag. A div element can contain another div tag inside it as well.
You may also use tags for ordered lists and for unordered ones. Individual list items must be enclosed by the tag. For example, this is how a basic unordered list looks like in HTML:

Inline Tags
Many inline tags are used to format text. For example, a  tag would render an element in bold, whereas  tags would show it in italics.

Hyperlinks are also inline elements that require tags and href attributes to indicate the link’s destination:

Images are inline elements too. You can add one using  without any closing tag. But you will also need to use the src attribute to specify the image path, for example:

HTML Evolution. What Differs Between HTML and HTML5?
Since the first days, HTML has gone through an incredible evolution. W3C constantly publish new versions and updates, while historical milestones get dedicated names as well.

HTML4 (these days commonly referred to as “HTML”) was published in 1999, while the latest major version came out in 2014. Named HTML5, the update has introduced many new features to the language.

One of the most anticipated features of HTML5 is native support for audio and video embedding. Instead of using Flash player, we can simply embed videos and audio files to our web pages using the new  and  tags. It also includes in-built support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) and MathML for mathematical and scientific formulas.

HTML5 introduced a few semantic improvements as well. The new semantic tags inform browsers about the meaning of content, which benefits both readers and search engines.

The most popular semantic tags are , , and To find amore unique differences, consider checking our in-depth HTML and HTML5 comparison.

Pros and Cons of HTML
Like most things, HTML comes with a handful of strengths and limitations.

Pros:

A widely used language with a lot of resources and a huge community behind.
Runs natively in every web browser.
Comes with a flat learning curve.
Open-source and completely free.
Clean and consistent markup.
The official web standards are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
Easily integrable with backend languages such as PHP and Node.js.
Cons:

Mostly used for static web pages. For dynamic functionality, you may need to use JavaScript or a backend language such as PHP.
It does not allow the user to implement logic. As a result, all web pages need to be created separately, even if they use the same elements, e.g. headers and footers.
Some browsers adopt new features slowly.
Browser behavior is sometimes hard to predict (e.g. older browsers don’t always render newer tags).
How are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript related?
While HTML is a powerful language, it isn’t enough to build a professional and fully responsive website. We can only use it to add text elements and create the structure of the content.

However, HTML works extremely well with two other frontend languages: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. Together, they can achieve rich user experience and implement advanced functions.

CSS is responsible for stylings such as background, colors, layouts, spacing, and animations.
JavaScript lets you add dynamic functionality such as sliders, pop-ups, and photo galleries.
Think of HTML as a naked person, CSS as the clothing, and JavaScript as movements and manner.

So…What is HTML?
HTML is the main markup language of the web. It runs natively in every browser and is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium.

You can use it to create the content structure of websites and web applications. It’s the lowest level of frontend technologies, that serves as the basis for styling you can add with CSS and functionality you can implement using JavaScript.</p>
